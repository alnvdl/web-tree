WeB-tree
========

A HTML5/JS implementation of a B-tree.

This was a college project (Data Structures II). It's a simple B-tree implementation with graphic visualization using the HTML5 canvas. We had to implement many things from the scratch, like scrolling and node drawing (and of course, the B-tree itself).

There's a live preview: http://alnvdl.github.com/WeB-tree/
