# alnvdl/web-tree

A HTML5/JS implementation of a B-tree.

This was a college project (Data Structures II). It's a simple B-tree
implementation with graphic visualization using the HTML5 canvas. We had to
implement many things from the scratch, like scrolling and node drawing (and of
course, the B-tree itself).

This was done together with @guiocm and Marcus Vin√≠cius Ramires do Nascimento.

There's a live preview: https://alnvdl.github.io/web-tree/
